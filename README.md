# WallPY

Repo for handling AFM data primarly in .ibw-files. 
Will include conversion to hdf5-format using hystorian.
Hystorian will also provide the ability to perform transformations in-place and override converted hdf5 files.
Implementation of useful gwyddion functionality since gwypy is soon to be completely deprecated.
Finally, essential and fundamental plotting functions for more efficient and re-usable plotting than achieved in gwyddion.

In addition, WallPY can handle AFM-data from most AFM distributors, such as NT-MDT and Nanosurf, after manually exporting the raw data file to .gwy-file using gwyddion.
